    public var hiFiGain: Float?
    /**
        This value affects how far a user's sound will travel in 3D space, without affecting the user's loudness.
        By default, there is a global attenuation value (set for a given space) that applies to all users in a space. This default space attenuation is usually 0.5, which represents a reasonable approximation of a real-world fall-off in sound over distance.
        
        Lower numbers represent less attenuation (i.e. sound travels farther); higher numbers represent more attenuation (i.e. sound drops off more quickly).
        
        When setting this value for an individual user, the following holds:
     
        - Positive numbers should be between 0 and 1, and they represent a logarithmic attenuation. This range is recommended, as sounds more natural.
        - Smaller numbers represent less attenuation, so a number such as `0.2` can be used to make a particular user's audio travel farther than other users', for instance in "amplified" concert type settings. Similarly, an extremely small non-zero number (e.g. `0.00001`) can be used to effectively turn off attenuation for a given user within a reasonably sized space, resulting in a "broadcast mode" where the user can be heard throughout most of the space regardless of their location relative to other users.
            - Note: The actual value `0` is used internally to represent the default; for setting minimal attenuation, use small non-zero numbers instead. See also `userRolloff` below.
        - Negative attenuation numbers are used to represent linear attenuation, and are a somewhat artificial, non-real-world concept. However, this setting can be used as a blunt tool to easily test attenuation, and tune it aggressively in extreme circumstances. When using linear attenuation, the setting is the distance in meters at which the audio becomes totally inaudible.
        
        If you don't supply an `userAttenuation` when constructing instantiations of this class, `userAttenuation` will be `nil` and the default will be used.
        
        ✔ The client sends `userAttenuation` data to the server when `_transmitHiFiAudioAPIDataToServer()` is called.
        
        ❌ The server never sends `userAttenuation` data.
     */
    public var userAttenuation: Float?
    /**
        This value represents the progressive high frequency roll-off in meters, a measure of how the higher frequencies in a user's sound are dampened as the user gets further away. By default, there is a global roll-off value (set for a given space), currently 16 meters, which applies to all users in a space. This value represents the distance for a 1kHz rolloff. Values in the range of 12 to 32 meters provide a more "enclosed" sound, in which high frequencies tend to be dampened over distance as they are in the real world.
        
        Generally, you should change roll-off values for the entire space rather than for individual users, but
        extremely high values (e.g. `99999`) may be used in combination with "broadcast mode"-style `userAttenuation` settings to cause the broadcasted voice to sound crisp and "up close" even at very large distances.
        
        If you don't supply an `userRolloff` when constructing instantiations of this class, `userRolloff` will be `nil`.
